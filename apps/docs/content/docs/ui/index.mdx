As demand for programmatic video creation continues to rise, Clippkit offers a growing set of reusable building blocks designed to help developers move faster. These scenes, effects, and components are made to mix, match, and extend however you like - saving time, ensuring consistency, and letting you focus on what really matters: making great videos with code.

Whether you're building content for YouTube, TikTok, product demos, or even full-blown video editors, Clippkit gives you a head start with components that look good out of the box, animate smoothly, and follow a consistent structure.
This is a project by and for developers who want to create video content using code, and we’re hoping it grows into something the whole community can build on.

### 💡 Why use it

- You’re tired of copy-pasting the same motion logic into your Remotion projects.
- You want components that look good out of the box but are still fully customizable.
- You care about structure, reusability, and clean code - not timelines in After Effects.
- You’re building video products, short-form content, or visual storytelling tools with React.
- You want to treat video scenes the same way you treat UI - with design systems, consistency, and reusability.

### 🧩 How it works

Clippkit components are just React components. You import them into your Remotion composition, pass in your content (text, images, video paths), and you're ready to go. Everything is built with customization in mind - from timing and delay props to animation styles and layout overrides. Use them as-is, or fork and tweak to make your own design system for video.
