### What You’ll Need First

<Callout title="Requires a Remotion Project" type="warn">
  Clippkit components only work inside a Remotion setup. If you haven’t got one
  running yet, check out the [Remotion getting started
  guide](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/) first.
</Callout>

### CLI Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to add Clippkit components to your project is using the shadcn/ui CLI:

```package-install
npx shadcn@latest add "https://clippkit.com/r/card-flip"
```

This will automatically:
- Download the component code
- Install any required dependencies
- Place the component in your project's components directory
- Set up the necessary imports

---

### Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer to install components manually or need to customize the installation:

1. **Browse the Docs:** Pick a component you'd like to use.
2. **Copy the Code:** Each component page includes its source code.
3. **Add to Your Project:** Create a new file inside your Remotion app (e.g., `src/components/card-flip.tsx`) and paste the code in.
4. **Fix Imports (if needed):** Adjust any internal paths or helpers if your project's structure is different.
5. **Use It:** Now you can import and use the component like any other React component.

### Next Steps

Once you've installed a component (either via CLI or manually), you can:

1. **Import it** in your Remotion composition
2. **Customize the props** to match your design
3. **Add it to your video timeline**

Check out the individual component pages for detailed usage examples and API documentation.
