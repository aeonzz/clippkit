### What You’ll Need First

<Callout title="Requires a Remotion Project" type="warn">
  Clippkit components only work inside a Remotion setup. If you haven’t got one
  running yet, check out the [Remotion getting started
  guide](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/) first.
</Callout>

### How to Use a Component (Manual Setup for Now)

Until the CLI is ready, here’s how to add a component manually:

1. **Browse the Docs:** Pick a component you’d like to use.
2. **Copy the Code:** Each component page includes its source.
3. **Add to Your Project:** Create a new file inside your Remotion app (e.g., `src/components/PoppingText.tsx`) and paste the code in.
4. **Fix Imports (if needed):** Adjust any internal paths or helpers if your project’s structure is different.
5. **Use It:** Now you can import and use the component like any other React component.

We know this isn’t the smoothest setup, but it’s temporary. The idea is to give you full access while we finish the tooling.

### CLI Install – Coming Soon

We’re nearly there with a CLI to make this whole thing easier. You’ll soon be able to run something like:

      ```package-install
    npx shadcn@latest add "https://clippkit/r/sliding-text"
    ```

    This will set everything up for you automatically—no copy-pasting needed.
