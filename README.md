## Overview

**Clippkit** is a growing collection of reusable components for people building videos with Code ([Remotion](https://remotion.dev)). It's like a UI library, but instead of buttons and modals, you get intros, text effects, animations, transitions, and full video scenes.

If you're building videos in code, Clippkit gives you a head start. Each component is built with flexibility in mind and is easy to drop into any Remotion project.

## What It's For

Clippkit is for developers who want to:

- Build great-looking videos entirely in code
- Reuse common animation patterns (intros, loaders, blur effects, overlays)
- Assemble entire scenes without starting from scratch
- Save time without sacrificing design

## You're not locked into anything — everything is unstyled by default and customisable with Tailwind CSS or your own system.

## Built for Remotion

Clippkit isn't a video editor or video framework. It's just a library of clean, reusable pieces designed specifically for use with Remotion.

You still write your video logic in React. Clippkit just helps you move faster with a set of pre-built building blocks you can tweak, remix, and reuse.

## Example Components

Some of the things you'll find (and can copy/paste) include:

- Scene templates (like hero intros or split-screen layouts)
- Text animations and fade/slide effects
- Loading indicators, blur overlays, branded transitions
- Utilities for timing and layout in video space

We're adding more as we go — and the goal is to keep everything lightweight, flexible, and easy to override.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

This starts the documentation and registry locally so you can explore and test the components.

## Project Structure

Clippkit is a monorepo built with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build):

- `apps/registry` – the actual component source code
- `apps/docs` – the docs site with usage examples and previews
